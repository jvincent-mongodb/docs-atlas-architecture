To improve the resiliency of your cluster, upgrade your cluster to MongoDB 8.0. 
MongoDB 8.0 introduces the following performance improvements and new features 
related to resilience:

- `Improved memory management <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/resilient-application/#std-label-resilient-upgraded-tcmalloc>`__

- `Operation rejection filters <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/resilient-application/#std-label-resilient-operations-rejection-filters>`__ to reactively mitigate expensive queries

- `Cluster-level timeouts <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/resilient-application/#std-label-resilient-default-read-timeout>`__ for proactive protection against expensive read operations

- Better workload isolation with the `moveCollection command <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/resilient-application/#std-label-resilient-move-collection>`__
